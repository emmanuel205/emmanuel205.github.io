## Design Process Continued
  This week was an interesting week as we didnt have much time to work on our designs as we had a field trip to NASA on Thursday and an off day on Wednesday. On Monday we were assigned to go into Figma and to start our mockups for the week. We were supposed to make mockups showing our ITS elements and our design on how we want our system to look. We also had a presentation on Monday about AI systems and how theyre incorporated in many systems we use today. We talked about the many different systems that are out there and what they do. The second half on Monday and the full day on Tuesday was used to design our mockups. We then had those two days away from the lab and used the first half of Friday to work on our designs then we presented them at 2:30 on Friday. We got feedback in order to improve our mockups to be presented again the next week!
