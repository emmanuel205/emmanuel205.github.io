## The End
On Monday we had mock presentations that Dr. Mack wasnt necessarily pleased wiht but with a bit more practice I believe we would be fine. My demo video was also too long but it was fixxed by the end of the day. Tomorrow marks the day of the final presentations which Im excited for and ready to finish. I wish everyone the best and hope for a great showing.

Here we are the next day and im ready for the presentations. We dont present until 1:40pm so we had some time to watch everyone elses presentation. Dr. Mack was kind to provide lunch for everyone which was appreciated. I think everyone before and after us did really well and I was excited when seeing the difference between the mid-summer presentations and the final. I believe everyone made great progression since the mid-summer and I enjoyed every presentation throughly. I was very satisfied with our presentation and hope Dr. Mack was as well. For the rest of the week the focus now is to finish the technical report and make sure everything was turned it. On Wednesday Dr. Mack gave everyone completion certificates and had everyone in the game room.

I can honestly say I learned so much from this institute and really appreciate Dr. Mack. This was a great pportunity and our project even sparked my own idea which was the main thing I wanted from this institute. Dr, Mack even said I could email her my progress as Im goign which is very much appreciated. I want her to see the progress as she was a big part in the inspiration. I learned many things during this institute that I will take with me even further and cherish the the different people Ive met.
