## The End
On Monday we had mock presentations that Dr. Mack wasnt necessarily pleased wiht but with a bit more practice I believe we would be fine. My demo video was also too long but it was fixxed by the end of the day. Tomorrow marks the day of the final presentations which Im excited for and ready to finish.
