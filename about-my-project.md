## About My Project

CodeWiz: Level Up Your Code

Problem: There are many tutoring systems out here that teach certain concepts but were trying to create one that adapts to the individual users learning style.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Uses HTML, Javascript, React, and CSS to code together the tutoring system.
  - Creates a system that adapts to the user.(Still learning how to do that)
  - As we keep on going I will add more to this slide. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in an intelligent tutoring system that teaches python while adapting to the learning style of the individual user.
