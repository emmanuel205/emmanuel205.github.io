## Preparing for Mid Summer Presentation
This week started off a little rocky but I felt good with the ending. For majority of the institute we were working with another team in the same room. We were instructed to then go into seperate rooms to work together which I believe was a great choice. After going into a seperate room we had a meeting about which design between me and my other teammates we were gonna use. We then decided to use Amyras because I believe hers was done very well in terms of what Dr. Mack was looking for. I think my design was gamified well in terms of design but wasnt necessarily heavy on the ITS> It had elements but I beleive Amyras represented an ITS the best. Wvwryonw agreed so we decided to continue with hers and started redesigning some of the figma slides used.

We then started drawing up some versions of what our dashboard, awards page, navigation bar, and some minor changes in the lessons screen would be. We then chose the design for all of the slides and started to implement them. We then had show and tell and showed our designs and plan to have them the next week so we can finsih up our Mid Summer Report powerpoint.
