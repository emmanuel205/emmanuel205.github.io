## A Little Detour
This week was supposed to be the week of presentations. At the beginning of the week on Monday and Tuesday we used to finish up and practice our presentations. We had individual meetings with Dr. Mack to make sure we structured our presentation properly. The issue with our project was that we didnt necessarily have data statistics that support our project. So in terms of findings and our literature reviews we had to implement other things weve done. This included pictures of our group mock up and our individual mockups that we made in the process. So instead of data that other groups may have put into their presentation we had our individual mockups.

Unfortunutely on Tuesday we got a notification from Dr. Mack saying that the mid-summer symposieum was cancelled due to technical difficulties. I was really looking forward to it but sometimes thats just life. Dr. Mack then told us later on that shell be trying to have it next week Wednesday. For the rest of the week on Thursday and Friday the team gameplanned on what were trying to accomplish in the rest of the time during the institute. Unfortunutely at this point its not looking too good in terms of completely finishing but an ITS is very complex and Dr. Mack said it would take more time in order to fully finish it.
