## The Beginning
  After going through week one I can honestly say I had a great first week. I love how accomodating and clear that Dr. Mack, the faculty mentors, and the graduate mentors have been. I really appreciate everything theyve done and look forward to the rest of the time here. So far its been mainly an orientation/preparation week but I still learned a lot. Going through the week we first started off with introductions which gave a great overview of the schedule, expectations, and what good research practice was. I took down all the information and will add it here after I make it more organized. Im going to add the dates and expectations to my calendar to make sure im organized and im going to retain the information about the research practices so I get the most out of my experience. We then went on to the learning about what AI Research is which was very informative and I was fully in tune. I think we all know what AI is based on examples but its deeper than that, so I really appreciated the presentation. We then met our teammates and mentors on the day and went over our project. I had a great first day and it had me excited for what was to come.
  
  The previous day we also took a python placement test to see what class we would be taking the next day. Its funny because I used to go here and my major was computer science but unfortunutely forgot everything. So I placed in the python 101 class and noticed the slides they were using were the ones they used for the beginning computer science classes. As we kept getting into it, everything came back to me so in a way I already understood everything as we went. Not saying it arrogantly because at the end of the day I appreciated the refresher when it came to type casting, conditionals, loops, and functions. I was kind of frustrated at myself because then I remeber the test and felt like I shouldve known some of the things but theres no point in being mad since I never practiced. We also got a presentation on how to think like  a programmer from Clyde which was very informative and I was throughly interested. I loved all presentors but he was probably my favorite one.
  
  On Thursday we had a presentation from Andrew about machine learning and using scikit to code. My current major deals with data science and machine learning so most of the stuff he was talking about I knew but the coding was a whole new world. I throughly enjoyed learning about scikit and thought of ways for me to use scikit in my major. We then got into a presentation about Responsible Conduct of Research which was informative but not as interesting as the others. I still enjoyed it as there was a lot of information that was new to me and can be relevant in the future. We had a team ice breaker after lunch where we had to comptete to build the highest structure against the other project teams that could hold a marshmallow without falling. We unfortunutely didnt win but I had a great time with my teammates and look forward to working with them in the future. We then had another presentation about data analysis using pandas and numpy in python, which were new to me. The presentationw as going fast because of how much time we had left but I was understanding what I was being told and gathered many new ideas on how to use pandas and numpy for my data analysis strategies. I want to learn more and implement these strategies for assignments, projects, and competitions.
  
  On the last day of this week, we finished learning and coding with scikit and I was very satified at the end. Andrew is very much appreciated as he made sure we were getting things and we were all on the same page. The other two things we did included learning with about Githun and contructing our websites which I am typing for now. I pretty much knew nothing about github but  when I signed up my email was already used so I mustve come across it somewhere but forgot about it. Im glad that we did this because im getting inspiration to really make a nice website and to add many more things using html and CSS if possible. We also took headshots today, which again is very much appreciated since I didnt have an updated one in a long time. Im going to use it for not only this website but for linkedin and other professional websites.
  
  Wrapping it all up this was a great first week. Im very excited for whats to come especially after learning so much in a small period of time. Ive gotten a lot of inspiration and ideas on how to implement what ive been taught here in the first week into what im doing at Bowie. Next week we'll be doing a lot more lab work and getting into our projects which im excited to participate and eventually put down my progress in week 2 of next week.
