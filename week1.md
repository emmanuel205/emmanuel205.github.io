## The Beginning
  After going through week one I can honestly say I had a great first week. I love how accomodating and clear that Dr. Mack, the faculty mentors, and the graduate mentors have been. I really appreciate everything theyve done and look forward to the rest of the time here. So far its been mainly an orientation/preparation week but I still learned a lot.
