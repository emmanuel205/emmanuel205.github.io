## About Me
Hello everyone my name is Emmanuel Osuntuyi and im a rising senior attending Bowie State University. Im majoring in Business Information Systems and my expected graduation date is December 2025. I use to go to Morgan State University from 2020-2022 and I transferred to Bowie State University after taking a semester off after an unfortunate Car accident. Im very excited to take part in this AI Institute and I am very appreciative of this opportunity given by Dr. Mack. As I make more social accounts I will link it below.
