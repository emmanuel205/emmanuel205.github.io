## Final Presentation and Technical Report
At this point we are at week 9 and most of our integrated feautures work but were just trying to fix the little things. Amyras chatbot works to display the lesson and my IDE is working well but it just needs to be adjusted in terms of its format. Kye was unable to get his cnversational AI to work so he started making the quiz part of our Lessons. Im very proud of the IDE I made as it was prewritten instructions for the practice, code along, and projects. The code runs and it lets you know where, what, and how to fix your error. I also added a pop up function to let you knwo if your code was right or wrong. If it was wrong it would give you a hint on what it was.

With our parts working we then shifted out focus to completing our powerpoint and starting our technical report. Our powerpoint consisted of a lot more information and we all had seperate demo videos showcasing what we had done. We had our tools, methodology, and other factors that werent the same as last time that I believe gave a more in depth presentation. We also started adding information to our template for our technical report. Next week is our final presentation so Im looking forward to it.
