## Mid-Summer Presentation
I believe on Monday Dr. Mack was still in the process of trying to see if we were going to have the mid-summer presentation and by what she was saying it didnt seem like we would have it. Regardless even if it was brought up that we would have it last minute, I believed that me and my team were good in terms of presentation. The rest of the day was used to break up the parts and determine what we need to make in terms of the next step since not everything would get done. On Tuesday Dr. Mack let us know that the mis-summer symposieum would happen the next day. I was excited to know that we would be able to present but it was unfortunate that I had to run back to my house last minute to get my suit. 

The day of presentations was a great day. Not many outside people showed up as it was mainly all the institute teams but Im still glad we all got together. I had a number of projects I wanted to see including the AI Robot wheelchai project, Emotigen, and the lung cancer project. I also looked forward to seeing my labs projects as I wish them nothing but the best. I throughly enjoyed everyones presentation and beleive we all did really good. The emotigen presentation was the one that stood out the most to me because of obvious reasons for anybody who was there. I felt really good and was optimistoc about the rest of the institute.

I also forgot to mention that this was the week for the beginning of CodeBears which I was looking forward to. I wanted to connect with some of the kids as nurturing the ones under us is what gives maximum growth in my opinion. I appreciate Dr. Mack for trusting me and Amyra to watch the kids when going to lunch. Im also thankful as taking them to lunch provided myself with lunch as well. Im definetly looking forward to the next week and figuring out what well be needing to put togehter in order to represent AI integration for our final presentation.
