## Getting Into the Design Phase
This week was interesting as we are starting to get into the design phase of this project. Its more setting the foundation and learning about how we're going to get into the phase but nonetheless we are starting to get more into the actually building of the project. This week we started our literature review and learned about figma. Figma is where you can design apps or basically make the design for whatever type of application youre trying to put together. We were tasked with designing a copy of an app from a list of popular apps so we can present them to our labs. We also did research for our literature review which consisted of the front end, back end, and conversational AI. 

I had the front end which consist of doing research on current intelligent tutoring systems and how theyre designed look wise. We also had to make a powerpoint of our literature reviews to present at the end of the week as well. There was also a workshop on overflow which helped us code a template for technical report. I had a great time this week as we are learning these skills to move into the next phase of project which is the design phase.
