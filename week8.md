## AI Integration and the Plan Going Forward

 At the beginning of the week Dr. Mack had a meeting with our team to discuss what we should be aiming to finish by the end of the institute. She emphasized that we wont be able to make a fully functional website, but we can definetly present some of our projects AI Integration. We then broke up our task into three parts. Amyra was going to make a chatbot that Dubbie would do the lessons through, I would make an IDE for lessons, and Kye would make the live conversational AI agent. This started the beginning of our integration and thought it would be faster if we all did seperate parts. 

 For the chatbot we Amyra came up with multiple ideas in terms of hard coding one or using IBM Watson. Kye was given some options from Dr. Mack and Andrew in order to get his conversational AI developed and he chose to use convai. I did research using Google and Youtube in order to figure out how to make the IDE. I found a great guidline in order to make the IDE but after making it regularly I would have to hard code it to adjust it for my screens. This is our current process and will continue to try our hardest to finsih it. We also have to start thinking of the information for our technical report.
