##The Progression
During this week we got into a lot of learning code and implementing the code. We finished our modules on CSS and HTML, and we were tasked with implementing it by making a website showcasing the two coding languages. As a group we acheived major results as we all constructed a website with different elements and all had different ideas. In reference to mine I made a website with 5 pages that were the home page, background, 2023, 2024, my goals for the year. My website is meant to be a personal one that is going to track my life progress and keep me on track with my goals by documentation. I used html to make the navigation bars, to but a border around my title, and to implement the words used. I used CSS to customize my website and to make it visually appealing.
I was using <img> files, <nav> files, and a lot of <style> files but I will be more specific as my website grows. I was a little frustrated with implementing my images but my project groupmate Amyra explained that I needed the image in the file that was actually in Visual Studio Code. I was very satisfied with having to make our videos because I think its a great way to track progress and to connect with your teammates. I look forward to doing the discussion posts and seeing everybodys progress. The biggest thing for me was the show and tell which showed the seriousness of Dr. Mack for those who didnt understand. She truly stands on business when it comes to this and has high expectations. I look forward to satisfying her and meeting those expectations. The show and tell made me want to work even harder.
